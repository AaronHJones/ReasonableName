Once upon a time, there was a cat named Brot who lived in a biergarten. 
Brot liked this very much since the Lederhose wearing owner, Fr√§ulein Mehlhase, gave him a Bratwurst every day.
But one day, as Brot was getting a Brat, a Hund jumped out of a BMW and started after Brot. 
The Hund was after Brots Bratwurst, the Hund was jeolous and proposed a contest for the Bratwurst,
appealing to Brots wet-tbewerbsfaehig nature, Brot accepted.
Whoever jumped over the Kilmaanlage of the Baeckerei nextdoor first, would win; the race was on.
