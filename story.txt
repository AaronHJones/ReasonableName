Once upon a time, there was a cat named Brot who lived in a biergarten. 
Brot liked this very much since the Lederhose wearing owner, Fr√§ulein Mehlhase, gave him a Bratwurst every day.
But one day, as Brot was getting a Brat, a Hund jumped out of a BMW and started after Brot. 
The Hund was after Brots Bratwurst, the Hund was jealous and proposed a contest for the Bratwurst,
appealing to Brots wet-tbewerbsfaehig nature. Brot accepted.
Whoever jumped over the Kilmaanlage of the Baeckerei nextdoor first, would win; the race was on.
The Hund however was very fat due to consuming far too many Gebaeck from the local Baeckerei, so as a result he tripped as Brot gracefully lept over the Kilmaanlage
with ease, filled with a sense of schadenfreude. Brot although inhalt with the results saw the sadness on the Hund's face who just wanted a chance to experience
a Bratwurst, so despite everything Brot had a moment of das Mitleid for the Hund.
While Brot wasn't about to give up his hard-earned Bratwurst, he believed that if the Hund
was given the opportunity to pull himself up by his own Hundstraps, he may be able to earn a 
Bratwurst of his own, so Brot decided to introduce the Hund to the owner of the local
Ratskeller, which was looking for a guard dog to protect their casks from covetous drunks. 
But as the Hund and Brot were nearing the Ratskeller, a bus from the Flughafen playing loud
RammsteinMusik and driving erratically on the Hauptstrasse, and ran up on the curb.
