Once upon a time, there was a cat named Brot who lived in a biergarten. 
Brot liked this very much since the Lederhose wearing owner, Fr√§ulein Mehlhase, gave him a Bratwurst every day.
But one day, as Brot was getting a Brat, a Hund jumped out of a BMW and started after Brot. 
The Hund was after Brots Bratwurst, the Hund was jealous and proposed a contest for the Bratwurst,
appealing to Brots wet-tbewerbsfaehig nature. Brot accepted.
Whoever jumped over the Kilmaanlage of the Baeckerei nextdoor first, would win; the race was on.
The Hund however was very fat due to consuming far too many Gebaeck from the local Baeckerei, so as a result he tripped as Brot gracefully lept over the Kilmaanlage
with ease, filled with a sense of schadenfreude. Brot although inhalt with the results saw the sadness on the Hund's face who just wanted a chance to experience
a Bratwurst, so despite everything Brot had a moment of das Mitleid for the Hund.
While Brot wasn't about to give up his hard-earned Bratwurst, he believed that if the Hund
was given the opportunity to pull himself up by his own Hundstraps, he may be able to earn a 
Bratwurst of his own, so Brot decided to introduce the Hund to the owner of the local
Ratskeller, which was looking for a guard dog to protect their casks from covetous drunks. 
But as the Hund and Brot were nearing the Ratskeller, a bus from the Flughafen playing loud
RammsteinMusik and driving erratically on the Hauptstrasse, and ran up on the curb.
"Ach, du lieber!" cried the Hund. "This horrible driving! This RammsteinMusik! It reminds me of
my poor owner, swerving about recklessly on the Autobahn in his fuel-efficient and perfectly
engineered BMW. In my selfish lust for another's Bratwurst, I forgot about him entirely.
Oh woe is the beast that overlooks what's important in life while in blind pursuit
of the ever-elusive sausage. I am the wurst!"
